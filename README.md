# Deep-Learning-in-Genomics



## Deep Learning Models
This section likely includes various deep learning models that are suited for genomic data. Models like CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks), RNNs (Recurrent Neural Networks), and perhaps more specific architectures like autoencoders or GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) could be featured, designed to handle the sequential and complex nature of genomic data.

## Datasets
It's common for such repositories to include scripts or utilities for handling datasets specific to genomics, such as sequence data, genetic variation data, and phenotype labels. There could be preprocessing scripts to prepare this data for training deep learning models.

## Training Scripts
Scripts to train the models on the genomic data, possibly with detailed comments on parameters used, the architecture setup, and outputs.
Notebooks: Jupyter notebooks are often used for tutorial purposes. They might contain step-by-step guides and visualizations that show how to apply deep learning models to genomic data, interpret the results, and perhaps compare different models.
Results: This folder might contain graphs, logs, and saved model weights. These artifacts are useful for evaluating the model's performance, understanding the learning process, and further tuning.

## Potential Applications:
- Disease Prediction: Using genomic data to predict disease susceptibility, progression, and treatment outcomes.
- Genetic Engineering: Enhancing the capabilities of genetic engineering by predicting outcomes of genetic modifications.
- Ancestry Analysis: Deep learning can help in refining approaches to determining ancestry details from complex genetic data.
- Personalized Medicine: Tailoring medical treatment to individual genetic profiles, enhancing efficacy and reducing adverse effects.
## Usage:
For Researchers: Researchers in bioinformatics and genomics can use these models and scripts as a baseline for their experiments or for comparative studies.
For Educators and Students: The notebooks especially would be beneficial for educational purposes, providing a hands-on approach to learning about deep learning applications in genomics.
## Skills Gained:
- Deep Learning: Understanding and implementing various deep learning architectures.
- Genomic Data Handling: Skills in preprocessing and managing genomic datasets.
- Model Evaluation: Learning how to interpret model outputs and refine models based on performance metrics.
